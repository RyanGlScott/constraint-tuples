This library provides classes and type aliases that emulate the behavior of
GHC's constraint tuple syntax. Unlike GHC's built-in constraint tuples, the
types in this library can be partially applied.

This library exposes four different modules that provide essentially the same
API with slight differences in their implementation:

* `Data.Tuple.Constraint`: A `CTupleN` class compiles to a dictionary data type
   with `N` fields.
* `Data.Tuple.Constraint.ClassNewtype`: A `CTupleN` class compiles to a newtype
   around the corresponding built-in constraint tuple type with `N` arguments.
* `Data.Tuple.Constraint.TypeFamily`: A `CTupleN` type alias is a constraint
  tuple type constructor with `N` arguments obtained by way of a type family.
  This will compile to a built-in constraint tuple, but casted with a
  type family axiom.
* `Data.Tuple.Constraint.TypeSynonym`: A `CTupleN` type alias is a constraint
  tuple type constructor with `N` arguments obtained by way of a type synonym.
  This will compile directly to a built-in constraint tuple, but because this
  requires use of GHC features only present on 8.0 or later, this module does
  not export anything on earlier versions of GHC.
