-- | This module provides classes that emulate the behavior of GHC's constraint
-- tuple syntax. Unlike GHC's built-in constraint tuples, the classes in this
-- library can be partially applied.
--
-- Unlike "Data.Tuple.Constraint", a @CTupleN@ class defined in this module
-- (where @N@ is greater than 1) compiles to a newtype around the corresponding
-- built-in constraint tuple type with @N@ arguments in Core. In contrast, a
-- @CTupleN@ class defined in "Data.Tuple.Constraint" compiles to a
-- dictionary data type with @N@ fields in Core.
--
-- For most use cases, this distinction is of no practical consequence. One
-- scenario where you may benefit from using this module is when you are
-- interoperating with built-in constraint tuple syntax.
-- For example, in this code:
--
-- @
-- data Dict :: Constraint -> Type where
--   Dict :: c => Dict c
--
-- foo :: CTuple2 a b => Dict (a, b)
-- foo = Dict
-- @
--
-- If you use the @CTuple2@ class from "Data.Tuple.Constraint" to define
-- @foo@, then in the Core for @foo@, the @a@ and @b@ must be extracted from
-- the @CTuple2@ dictionary before building the @Dict@ dictionary. On the other
-- hand, if you use the @CTuple@ class from this module, then no such
-- extraction is necessary, as the Core can simply cast the @CTuple2@
-- dictionary (which is a newtype) to the @(a, b)@ dictionary and use that to
-- construct a @Dict@ dictionary.
